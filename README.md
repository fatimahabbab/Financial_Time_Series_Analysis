# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Stock Prices

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and forecast the closing prices of a selected stock using various time series models. The primary objective is to develop a robust forecasting model that can predict future stock prices with high accuracy.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code and analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Fetch historical stock price data using `yfinance` and preprocess it for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data.

### 3. Stationarity Testing

- Conduct tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) to check for stationarity and apply differencing if necessary.

### 4. Modeling

- Develop and fit time series models such as ARIMA to the preprocessed data.

### 5. Model Diagnostics

- Evaluate model residuals for autocorrelation and normality using diagnostic plots.

### 6. Forecasting

- Generate out-of-sample forecasts and visualize the results.

### 7. Evaluation

- Assess the accuracy of the forecasts using evaluation metrics like RMSE.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis and forecasting techniques to predict stock prices. The steps outlined above provide a comprehensive approach to building a forecasting model, from data collection to evaluation.

## Future Work

- Experiment with advanced models such as GARCH and LSTM.
- Apply the methodology to different stocks and financial instruments.
- Enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as trading volume and macroeconomic indicators.
